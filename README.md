This navigates to the client directory, and creates a production build of the ReactJS frontend.

### `npm start`

This starts the NodeJS server on PORT 8080.
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.
The frontend is automatically served by NodeJS from the ReactJS build folder on initial page load.
